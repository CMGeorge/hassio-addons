Hassio add-on for a REST server endpoint for a keras prediction model. Only supporting NVIDIA Jetson Nano platforms.
Based on [Adrian Rosebrock's](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/05/deep-learning-production-keras-redis-flask-apache/) and [Shane Soh's](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deploy-machine-learning-models-with-keras-fastapi-redis-and-docker-4940df614ece) blog posts. Models frozen and converted as detailed in [Chengwei's](https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-run-keras-model-on-jetson-nano/) post and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44274701/make-predictions-using-a-tensorflow-graph-from-a-keras-model).
Intended to be used with a component like https://github.com/robmarkcole/HASS-rest-image-process

DOES NOT WORK, DO NOT USE
